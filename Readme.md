## Project Vision
In a world where online learning has become the norm, maintaining learner motivation is a challenge. Our vision is to:

1. **Encourage Engagement**: Turn passive learning into an interactive experience by rewarding progress.
2. **Boost Completion Rates**: Provide tangible incentives for learners to complete their courses.
3. **Empower Learners**: Use blockchain technology to give learners control and ownership of their achievements.


## Key Features

1. **Milestone Completion Rewards**:
   - Users earn tokens when they achieve predefined milestones in their courses.
   - This encourages learners to stay consistent and engaged with the material.

2. **Token Management**:
   - Users can track their earned tokens using the `getTokensBalance` function.
   - Tokens can be withdrawn seamlessly, offering flexibility to the users.

3. **Owner Controls**:
   - The contract owner has the ability to set or update the reward amount per milestone using the `setTokenReward` function.

4. **Blockchain Transparency**:
   - All milestone completions and token transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring an immutable and tamper-proof record.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - The smart contract is designed to support various types of courses and milestones, making it adaptable for different educational platforms.



## Future Enhancements
1. **Course Integration**:
   - Develop APIs to integrate the smart contract with popular online learning platforms, enabling seamless milestone tracking.

2. **Dynamic Reward Mechanism**:
   - Introduce a dynamic reward system where token rewards scale with milestone difficulty or course popularity.

3. **NFT Rewards**:
   - Issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as certificates or badges for milestone completions, providing users with unique, verifiable proof of their achievements.

4. **Token Utility Expansion**:
   - Allow tokens to be used within the ecosystem, such as for purchasing advanced courses, redeeming merchandise, or accessing premium content.

5. **Leaderboard and Social Features**:
   - Add a gamified leaderboard to encourage competition among users.
   - Introduce social sharing features to let users showcase their achievements.
